Node.js CRUD application
A CRUD application builds with node js and express as backend and mongoDB for database.

PACKAGES YOU NEED:
1.	NODEMON => Creates a live reload server, track for changes and restart the app automatically.
2.	EXPRESS => for creating middleware, routes. It makes your code look cleaner.
3.	EJS => to output dynamic data like showing details of users/blogs etc.
4.	MONGOOSE => it’s an Object Document Mapping library, use to create model and schema and to connect with the database.

FOR DATABASE: 
MONGODB => it’s a nosql database which uses collection and documents instead of tables, rows and columns.
